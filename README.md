# Maze Game

This project is a simple JavaScript-based maze game that generates a random maze and allows the player to navigate through it using the arrow keys. The objective is to reach the green exit square to win the game.

## How It Works

- The maze is generated using a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm, which creates random paths by carving out passages in a grid. The algorithm starts at the top-left corner and randomly explores neighboring cells to create a solvable maze.

- The player starts at the top-left corner (0,0) and navigates through the maze using the arrow keys. The goal is to reach the bottom-right corner where the green exit square is located.

## Development Roadmap

1. **Responsive Design Implementation**: A planned update will dynamically adjust the maze and controls to fit mobile screen sizes.
2. **Cell Size Adjustment**: Cell sizes will be adjusted based on screen dimensions to ensure proper appearance on all devices.
3. **User Interface Improvements**: The control panel and other UI elements will be optimized for mobile devices.

Follow the progress of these updates in the project issues or contribute directly to the codebase.
